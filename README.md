# Learning Laplacian Positional Encodings for Heterophilous Graphs
[AISTATS 2025] Learning Laplacian Positional Encodings for Heterophilous Graphs

## Reproducibility
This github contains the code used in the paper "Learning Laplacian Positional Encodings for Heterophilous Graphs".

## Instructions
1. In the generation directory, use the command "source generate_benchmarks.sh" to download and preprocess datasets from pytorch geometric
2. Once the datasets are downloaded and preprocessed, use the command "source search.sh" to train models and save results to the results directory
3. Once models are trained and results are saved, load the results in the "load_results.ipynb"
