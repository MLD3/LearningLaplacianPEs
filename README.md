[AISTATS 2025] Learning Laplacian Positional Encodings for Heterophilous Graphs

## Instructions for Reproducibility
1. In the `generation` directory, use the command `source generate_benchmarks.sh` to download and preprocess datasets from PyTorch Geometric.
2. Once the datasets are downloaded and preprocessed, use the command `source search.sh` to train models and save results to the `results` directory.
3. After training the models and saving the results, load the results in the `load_results.ipynb` notebook located in the `results` directory.
